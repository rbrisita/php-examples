Select edited files that worked in a proprietary system that helped web application developers start producing application specific logic quickly. The system took responsibility of page generation and asset injection depending on the organization's multiple news properties. This produced a workflow that allowed a designer or developer to clone either a front-end or backend seed that mapped directly to a contained web application. Assets were overwritable through initialization files, as the developer was treated as a first class citizen. The system uses the Laravel 3.2 framework. The presented files were for a Voter Guide project.
